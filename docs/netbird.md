# NetBird: reaching a device from away

A TECHO5 device can join your [NetBird](https://netbird.io) network, the other way, beside
[Tailscale](tailscale.md), to keep a device in another house in your own Home Assistant. Use NetBird's
own service or a management server you run yourself.

It's off until you turn it on, and nothing of it is in the image. The first time you join, the device
downloads NetBird's client (about 14 MB, 40 MB unpacked). That download is checked against the size and
SHA-256 the device's own software was built with. It's offered wherever Tailscale is: Echo Shows, the
Echo Spot and the Skylight, on a 64-bit kernel. The Echo Dots don't offer it.

## What it does, and what it doesn't

The same as Tailscale, by the same rules (see [what Tailscale does](tailscale.md#what-it-does-and-what-it-doesnt)):

- **Home Assistant over NetBird.** Home Assistant reaches the device on its usual encrypted ESPHome
  connection (port 6053), at its NetBird name or address.
- **The setup page, only with Remote setup.** Over NetBird the web port answers nothing else.
- **SSH, if you turned it on.**
- **Nothing else gets in.** The device's own firewall lets NetBird's interface reach only ports 6053,
  8181 and 22, and ping. NetBird's access policies apply on top, from your dashboard.
- **The device takes nothing from the network.** No DNS, no routes, no IPv6, no NetBird SSH server. NetBird's
  own firewall on the device is off: the device's firewall does that job. The client sends NetBird no
  metrics. It does talk to your management server, and to NetBird's signal and relay servers, which is
  how peers find each other.
- **Announcements, Drop In and shared settings stay in each house.**

## Set it up

1. **Make sure Home Assistant's link to the device has an encryption key.** Without one, the device
   won't turn NetBird on.
2. **Make a setup key** in your NetBird dashboard: **Setup Keys → Create Setup Key**. Make it one-off,
   with a short expiry. Give it a group (say `techo5`) so your access policies can name the devices.
3. **Give the device the key.** Either:
   - the setup page: **Connections → NetBird**, paste the key, and if you run your own NetBird, put
     your management server's URL (`https://netbird.example.com`). Leave it empty for NetBird's own.
     Then **Join**. The first time, Join starts the client's download and says so: when the page
     shows NetBird needs a setup key, paste the key again and press **Join**. Use an `https://`
     address: with `http://` the setup key crosses the network unencrypted.
   - Home Assistant: the [`netbird_login` action](actions.md#join-a-netbird-network).

   The key is used once, to join, and isn't kept. The **NetBird status** sensor then says
   *Connected as kitchen (100.x.y.z)*.
4. **Add the device to Home Assistant by its NetBird address or name.** The Home Assistant host has
   to be on the same NetBird network. In **Settings → Devices & services → ESPHome**, add the device by
   its NetBird address, with the same encryption key, and remove the old entry that used its home
   address.
5. **Take it where it goes,** and set up the Wi-Fi there. It rejoins by itself.

The **NetBird** switch, in Home Assistant and on the screen, stops it and starts it again; stopped,
the device keeps its place on the network and rejoins when turned back on. Remote setup works over
NetBird the same way as over Tailscale: see [Remote setup](tailscale.md#remote-setup).

## Access policies

A new NetBird network lets every peer reach every other. Narrow it in **Access Control → Policies**:
let only your Home Assistant host's group reach the `techo5` group on TCP 6053, and only your own
devices reach TCP 8181 and 22.

## Good to know

- **Tailscale or NetBird, not both on the same device.** Both number their devices in 100.64.0.0/10, and
  two at once can claim the same addresses.
- **Cost on the device:** nothing until you join, then about 40 MB of storage, and some memory while
  it runs.
- **Turning NetBird off** from far away cuts your way to it. Turning it back on then needs somebody
  there: the switch on the screen.
- **A device that goes missing** stays on your network until you remove it under **Peers** in the
  dashboard.
- **A diagnostics bundle leaves out** the device's NetBird name and address.
- The client is built from NetBird's own source by
  [tools/linux/build-netbird.sh](../tools/linux/build-netbird.sh), pinned to a tested version. Its
  client is BSD-3-Clause; the license comes with it, beside the client in the device's NetBird folder.
