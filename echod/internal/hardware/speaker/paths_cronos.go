// On cronos the AIC3101 codec is left as the kernel brings it up, the playback stream is driven
// at unity and the volume curve is applied in software; there is nothing to route, and the
// amplifier switch is never touched (see AmpSwitch below). One write matters: the MAX98396 comes
// up in "Speaker Safe Mode", a power cap that takes about 30 dB off the output (measured
// 2026-09-15: a 0.3 FS tone at the mic went from -47 to -15 dBFS when it was cleared). Amazon's
// HAL cleared it at boot; with Android on the null HAL nobody does, so the daemon does. Codec
// writes are cached until the stream powers up, which is why this goes before the first write.
//
// The 1st gen (checkers) has neither chip: a Realtek RT5616 codec and an amplifier on a GPIO, and
// the kernel leaves the codec connected to nothing, which Amazon's audio layer wired once at boot.
// Three things make it play, found on a unit by Empty2k12 (techo5-checkers docs/hardware.md), and
// missing any one is silence:
//   - Ext_Speaker_Amp_Switch is active low here: LineageOS plays with it Off. It is set Off once
//     and left, so AmpSwitch, which switches it On to play, stays empty on both generations.
//   - The DAC reaches the speaker through OUT MIX, OUTVOL and the line-out (not the headphone
//     pins), each step a switch to turn on.
//   - Two mutes share LOUT_CTRL1 (reg 03), OUT Playback Switch and OUT Channel Switch, both set
//     out of reset; with only the first cleared everything looks routed and nothing plays. A
//     switch at 1 is unmuted.
//
// The Show 8 (crown) has the same RT5616 on the same playback device, and the same sequence is
// what it wants: checked a write at a time on a unit 2026-09-22, where LineageOS had left the
// routing wired but OUT Playback Switch off and the amplifier switch On. Clearing the mute alone
// was not enough; setting Ext_Speaker_Amp_Switch Off is what reached the room, so crown's amplifier
// switch is active low as well and its separate amp_gpio is not the gate. A 1 kHz tone at 0.3 FS
// then read -4 dBFS at the microphones, up from -53. See TECHO5-CROWN crown-port-notes.md.
