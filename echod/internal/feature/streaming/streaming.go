// Package streaming makes the device a speaker other apps play to: AirPlay, from an iPhone, iPad or
// Mac (shairport-sync), and Spotify Connect, from the Spotify app (librespot). Each is a switch, off on
// a new device, in Home Assistant, on the settings screen and on the setup page.
//
// Both programs are found on the network by avahi, which runs only while one of them is on; the
// daemon's own announcements (ESPHome, Sendspin) go on beside it. Each program hands the daemon raw
// audio on its standard output, which plays as a received track, as a phone over Bluetooth does: a
// voice turn ducks or pauses it, an alarm sounds over it, and whatever is started last has the
// speaker. Each is restarted if it stops, after a pause that grows while it keeps stopping.
//
// Neither has been tried with a real phone at the time of writing: AirPlay was seen announced on the
// network, and the audio path is the Bluetooth one, but no Apple device and no Spotify Premium
// account were at hand.
