// audioOut places a cast's sound by output frame index, as the speaker's Source asks. The first chunk
// fixes where the phone's timeline lands on the card, and each chunk after it goes where its time says,
// so a burst of network jitter moves nothing: the chunk is either in time or dropped.
//
// The card's clock runs a little fast or slow against the phone's (about 200 ppm measured on this
// hardware, 12 ms a minute), so the mapping from time to frames, laid at the nominal rate, slides. It is
// corrected as sendspin's output is (feature/sendspin/output.go, where the reasoning for the numbers is):
// each render period the frame being heard is compared with the frame the clock says should be, the
// error is smoothed, and one frame is repeated or dropped per period while it is outside the band.
//
// driftGain smooths over about a second of periods; driftBand is 2 ms either side, the jitter that
// smoothing leaves; past snapBand the error is a misplaced anchor rather than drift and is put right in
// one step, and past maxSnap it is a clock that changed, so the next chunk anchors afresh. tailFrames is
// the hardware tail: the write counter is that far ahead of what is heard.
