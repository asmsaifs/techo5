// Package share keeps settings in step between the devices of the house, setting by setting, with the
// devices each one is chosen for, or copies settings to other devices once.
//
//   - A linked setting is kept in step with the devices it is linked to: a change on any of them, from the
//     screen, Home Assistant or the setup page, reaches the others, passed on from one to the next. There is
//     no leader. Each change is numbered one past the highest the device making it had seen, and the
//     highest number wins (the device's name breaks a tie), so the order does not rest on any device's clock.
//     A device that refuses a change as older answers with what it has, and the sender catches up.
//   - A link is made on each device, never by another: ticking a device for a setting here links it here and
//     asks that device, which links back only when somebody accepts there. A device can always take itself
//     out of a link.
//   - A copy sends settings to other devices once, with no link: from the setup page, or Home Assistant's
//     copy_settings action. Any device of the house can copy to a device that has sharing on; a copy landing
//     on a setting linked there is passed on to its links, as a change made there would be.
//   - Any device can keep any setting its own: nothing another device sends changes it, and the sender is
//     told it was kept.
//
// Off until it is turned on, on each device: one that has not been turned on takes nothing. Only the
// settings on the list (catalog.go) travel. Messages are signed with the house word and bound to the two
// devices (feature/announce's share.go). What a device takes, and from whom, is logged.
