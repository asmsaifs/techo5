// Night volume: as quiet hours start, a device left loud from the afternoon's music is turned down to
// a level somebody chose, so the first answer at bedtime is not a shout; as they end, it goes back to
// where it was.
//
// It turns the volume down once a night, as the hours start, and never again that night: somebody who
// turns it up at two in the morning wanted it up, and a restart does not undo that, since the night it
// last looked at is saved. It puts the level back only if it is still the one night volume set, so a
// level picked overnight is not undone by the morning. Changing the night volume inside the hours moves
// a device still at the old one to the new one, and none, or one above where it was, puts it straight
// back. Where it came down from and to are saved, so a restart in the night still puts it back, and a
// device that starts inside hours it has not looked at yet is turned down then.
//
// Muted, the level still moves, but the speaker stays silent: unmuting is somebody's choice.
//
// Alarms and timers ring at their own volume (config.Alarms.Ring), which starts from the daytime level
// rather than this one.
