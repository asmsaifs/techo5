// A camera's own sound, on this device's speaker, for as long as its view is up.
//
// The picture is fetched from Home Assistant one snapshot at a time (camera.go). The sound cannot be:
// it is a stream of AAC inside the camera's own video, and the device decodes nothing for the
// speaker but the WAV Home Assistant converts for it. So the sound is asked for the other way round —
// Home Assistant is told to play the camera's stream *to this device's media player*
// (camera.play_stream), and the stream it sends back is the ordinary one every other track arrives
// on: converted with ffmpeg on the way, streamed, and played by the media player like a radio
// station. Nothing about the camera's address, codecs or credentials is known here, which is the
// whole reason for doing it this way: every camera Home Assistant can stream is one this can hear.

// cameraSoundPoll is how often a view's sound is checked against the view still being up. A second is
// shorter than any view anybody asks for, and the check is a comparison under a lock. A variable only so
