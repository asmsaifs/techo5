// Package talkback sends the device's microphones to a camera's own speaker: Talk on the camera page,
// for answering the door from the kitchen. It goes straight to the camera, over the backchannel of its
// RTSP stream (ONVIF Profile T, lib/onvifback), so it needs no Home Assistant, go2rtc or Frigate in
// between: a camera on a Reolink recorder set up here is found by itself, any other is given its
// RTSP address on the setup page (config.TalkBack).
//
// The microphones go after echo cancellation, halved to 8 kHz and in G.711, which is what cameras
// with a speaker take. The camera's own sound, where it has one playing, can keep playing on the
// device meanwhile: the echo canceller takes it out of what is sent back.
//
// Talk is a toggle, not press-to-talk: a conversation at the door is not something to hold a finger
// on the glass through. The room is only sent while the camera page, with its red Talk bar, is what is
// on the screen: a talk ends on a second tap, the view closing, turning to another camera or being
// covered by anything else (a call, a ring, the settings), the Talk through cameras switch going off,
// the microphones being muted, the camera hanging up, or two minutes passing. While it lasts the view
// does not time out, and the wake word and the action button do not start a turn, as in a call.
