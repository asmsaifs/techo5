// with: the radio, the blinds, a light. Its event field is
//
//   - ringing: an alarm went off and is ringing
//   - silent: a silent alarm went off; it makes no sound and has nothing to stop, so this is all of it
//   - light_only: a light-only alarm's time came; its light has been up, the night has ended, and
//     there is nothing to stop
//   - snoozed: a ringing alarm was put off; it rings again later, with another ringing
//   - stopped: a ringing alarm was stopped, by a press, by voice, from Home Assistant, or by running
//     its course
//
