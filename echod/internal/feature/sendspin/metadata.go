// The wire encoding is tristate: a key the server omits means "unchanged, preserve the prior value",
// a JSON null means "clear it", and a value means "set it". The first two both arrive as a nil
// pointer, so the only thing that says which was meant is whether the key was there at all — HasField.

// them leave out most of it: the track is sent once and the progress ticks follow on their own.
