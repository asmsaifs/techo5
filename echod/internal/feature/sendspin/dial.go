// On the house's own network Music Assistant finds the device by mDNS and dials in (listen.go). A
// device farther away, reached over a VPN, can only be found from a list of addresses typed into
// Music Assistant, which it retries on its own schedule: after a stretch of the device being
// unreachable it can stop coming back at all, and the device then has music only in name. So the
// device also dials Music Assistant's Sendspin server, and keeps dialing, for as long as it has none.
