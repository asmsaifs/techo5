// Text over a photo. The wash laid over a slideshow picture calms it, but a wash light enough to
// leave a photo worth looking at leaves snow, sky or a white wall still bright, and the clock's pale
// text on it all but disappears. So on a photo the text looks after itself: behind each line, a soft
// patch of the ground color as dark as the picture there needs and no darker, and around the letters a
// thin dark edge for a picture that is light and dark in the same place. A dark photo is left almost
// as it was; a bright one gets dark just where the words are.
//
// Only small words get a patch: the weather, the date, the timers. The time and its AM/PM are large
// and bold enough to stand on the edge alone, and a patch the size of the clock is a smudge across
// the picture rather than a shadow under some words. Each line gets its own, hugging it.
//
// It is done in two passes. The first draws the page to a spare canvas, only to learn where its words
// go; the patches are laid under all of them; the second draws the page for real on top. One pass
// cannot do it, because a patch laid down for the date would darken the time drawn just above it.
// A page with no photo never comes here, so it draws exactly as it always has.
